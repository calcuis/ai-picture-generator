### ai-cryptopunk-generator

This Python code utilizes TensorFlow and Matplotlib to generate and visualize images using a pre-trained generative model. Here's a description of the code:

Import Libraries:
- import tensorflow as tf: Imports the TensorFlow library for machine learning and neural networks.
- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt: Imports the Matplotlib library for data visualization.

Set Parameters:
- seed = 42: Sets a seed for reproducibility.
- n_images = 25: Specifies the number of images to generate.
- codings_size = 100: Defines the size of the random input noise vector for the generator.
- generator = tf.keras.models.load_model("./models/"): Loads a pre-trained generative model using Keras.

Define Image Generation Function:
- generate(generator, seed): Defines a function to generate images using the pre-trained generator model.
- generator: The pre-trained generator model.
- seed: The seed for generating random noise.

Generate Images:
- noise = tf.random.normal(shape=[n_images, codings_size], seed=seed): Generates random noise as input to the generator.
- generated_images = generator(noise, training=False): Uses the generator to create images from the random noise.

Visualize Generated Images:
- Creates a 5x5 grid of subplots using Matplotlib to display the generated images.
- Loops through each generated image and adds it to the subplot.
- plt.axis('off'): Turns off axis labels for better visualization.
- plt.savefig("5x5_samples.png"): Saves the generated image grid to a file named "5x5_samples.png".

Execute the Generation:
- Calls the generate function with the pre-trained generator and the specified seed to create and visualize the images.

Overall, this code loads a pre-trained generative model, generates a set of images using random noise as input, and visualizes the results in a 5x5 grid, saving the output as "5x5_samples.png".
